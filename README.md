# Kriging
Tools for performing the Kriging interpolation of a function f:R->R. 
We use a quadratic regression to fit the sample points, and a Gaussian function for defining the covariance.
The main script is "KrigingInterpolation.m". 
Please refer to the slides in "KrigingInterpolationOverview.pdf" for details on the implementation.
